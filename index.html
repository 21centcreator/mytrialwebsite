          Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).<br><br>
        Still the greatest MCU film. Way better than that overrated Marvel's The Avengers, that overrated Guardians of the Galaxy, that overrated Black Panther, that overrated Avengers: Infinity War, and that massively overrated Avengers: Endgame. Iron Man is a fantastic masterpiece. Robert Downey Jr. proves to be the perfect actor to portray Iron Man/Tony Stark. Terrence Howard was way better as Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes than Don Cheadle. Don Cheadle sucks as War Machine/Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, Terrence Howard should have been War Machine for the other MCU films instead of Don Cheadle.</p>
